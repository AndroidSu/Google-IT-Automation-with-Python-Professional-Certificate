# Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certification
My projects for the Google IT Automation with Python certification

## Crash Course with Python (First module)
After learning the basics of Python it was required that we created a filter from any given String and filter certain words and symbols and after all the filtering print out the dictionary in a Wordcloud.
You will find the Jupyter Notebook with the assignment and the .txt book The Life of Abraham Lincoln that I used.

## Using Python to Interact with the Operating System (Week 6)
The bash script reads the files from the data/list.txt, stores it in a file (tempFile.txt) and the reads it to a variable where it goes through the files in the directory and checks if they exist.
The python script reads the result file (oldFiles.txt) and then renames each one of them from jane to jdoe.
