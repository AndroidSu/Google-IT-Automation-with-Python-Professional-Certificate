# Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certification
My projects for the Google IT Automation with Python certification

## Crash Course with Python (First module)
After learning the basics of Python it was required that we created a filter from any given String and filter certain words and symbols and after all the filtering print out the dictionary in a Wordcloud.
You will find the Jupyter Notebook with the assignment and the .txt book The Life of Abraham Lincoln that I used.

## Using Python to Interact with the Operating System (Week 6)
#### findJane.sh
The bash script reads the files from the data/list.txt, stores it in a file (tempFile.txt) and the reads it to a variable where it goes through the files in the directory and checks if they exist.
#### changeJane.py
The python script reads the result file (oldFiles.txt) and then renames each one of them from jane to jdoe.

## Using Python to Interact with the Operating System (Week 7)
### Final Project
#### Ticky_check.py
It will read the logs and generate two csv files based on the user counter and error counter on each line of the log file.
#### User_statistics.csv
This CSV file contains how many times each user appears on the info and error messages from the logs.
#### Error_Message.csv
This CSV file contains the types of errors on the logs file and the number of each occurrence.
 
## Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
### scale_image.py
#### Scale and convert images using PIL
This script executes the assignment. It reads all the icons in the image folder, rotates it 90 degrees clockwise, resizes to 128x128 and saves it on a different folder: "/opt/icons/"
